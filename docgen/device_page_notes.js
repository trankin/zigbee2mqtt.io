### Pairing

1. If there are blinking LEDs wait until they don’t blink anymore — the device is in some mode we don’t want it to be.
2. Press both buttons of the top row (or sole row for Model 6735) until the LEDs gleam permanently. They will blink alternately at first but keep the buttons pressed until really both lights are constantly illuminated. Then release the buttons. The LEDs should still glow.
3. Now press both buttons again briefly. After about 1..2 seconds they will fade-glow; and your bridge should now instantly find it.

### Known issues

#### Bottom row of 4-gang device not bound

It may occur that the bottom row of the 4-gang device 6737 does not work like the other ones, i.e. does not emit the actions (see related discussion [#7009](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/discussions/7009)). The reason is not fully understood yet, however it can be worked around by unbinding all four endpoints and re-binding them manually one after another:

| Source EP   | Destination   | Destination EP   | Clusters                                              |

### Action values
This device send the following \`action\` values in its payload:

| Left buttons                | (long-hold-release) | Right buttons            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| \`row_1_off\`<br>\`row_1_down\` | \`row_1_stop\`        | \`row_1_on\`<br>\`row_1_up\` |
| \`row_2_off\`<br>\`row_2_down\` | \`row_2_stop\`        | \`row_2_on\`<br>\`row_2_up\` |
| \`row_3_off\`<br>\`row_3_down\` | \`row_3_stop\`        | \`row_3_on\`<br>\`row_3_up\` |
| \`row_4_off\`<br>\`row_4_down\` | \`row_4_stop\`        | \`row_4_on\`<br>\`row_4_up\` |

Briefly pressing and releasing a button triggers the \`off\` resp. \`on\` actions for the given row, long-pressing triggers the \`down\`/\`up\` state respectively (after about one second). When releasing then, a \`stop\` will be issued with no distinction between the left or right button.

In case of problems it's recommended to remove device and than retry pairing and re-configuring device.

### Important
These devices can only be used on channel 26.
These devices are locked to the manufacturer's network key (ext_pan_id).
Your configuration file [data/configuration.yaml](../information/configuration) must contain the following:

\`\`\`yaml
advanced:
  ext_pan_id: [33,117,141,25,0,75,18,0]
  channel: 26
\`\`\`

Therefore these devices may not co-existence with other Zigbee devices.
Maybe, you need to add a dedicated coordinator and create a new network for Livolo.
If you decided to create a new network, you should specify another 'pan_id'.

### Configuring interface mode
There should be no need to configure into any interface mode as the Eva HAN should autodetect the correct mode.

### Not getting measurements
In case you are not getting any measurements, it could be that your firmware is too old. If firmware are < 0.4
either update fw via Eva Smart HUB or ask Datek for a replacement with min fw 0.4. Tested on 0.4.

    friendly_name: thermostat
    debounce: 1

### Pairing
To get the device into pairing mode, press the up button 3 times briefly and then hold it for a long time (almost 20s). After about 10s the LED starts blinking slowly, continue to hold until it starts blinking rapidly. Now you can release it. Pairing will take a while to complete. The LED will blink and change color during this process.

### Control
The shutter control uses a simple timer to control the duration to open/close the shutter. Unfortunately the Zigbee command to set the timer is not known yet. Even if you set the timer via Bluetooth, it will be reset to the default 2 minutes every time you bring it back to Zigbee mode.
The consequence is, that if your shutter is faster than 2 minutes, the position information will not match with the shutter position (since the transition from 0% to 100% takes 120s).
Example: If your shutter motor needs 20 seconds to move from open to closed, it will already be closed at 1/6 of the time, i.e. at position 85. It will still take 120s for the position information to go from 100 down to 0.

If you use a shutter motor with positional switches, that stops at the Open or closed position, this will not be an issue. If you rely on the control to shut of the motor, the current implementation will keep the motor pulling until the timer has elapsed, that might not be a good idea.
If your shutter motor needs more than 2 minutes, I suppose it will stop before reaching the final position.

### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
\`\`\`
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
\`\`\`

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

\`\`\` yaml
- id: 'Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature'
  alias: Auto_Publish_Outdoor_Temprature
  description: Automatically Publish the outdoor temperature to thermostats
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor
    platform: state
  condition: []
  action:

      payload_template: '{{ states(''sensor.outdoor_temprature_sensor'') | string }}'
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
    service: mqtt.publish
\`\`\`

### Enabling time
To enable _time_ you need to send a _blank_ message to the following MQTT topic:
\`\`\`
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_time
\`\`\`
Every time the above message is sent, Zigbee2MQTT will calculate the current time and send it to the thermostat.

        note: `
### General
The ubisys C4 remote control unit seems to be primarily targeted to be directly bound to other ZigBee devices to control them. Therefore it does not emit plain "click" events or similar but can be configured to send ZigBee commands like on, off, toggle, cover up, cover down etc. from up to 6 endpoints (4 with on/off, level and scene clusters for lights and another 2 to control window covering devices).
When used with Zigbee2MQTT all endpoints get bound to the coordinator automatically. Therefore all actions will be sent to the coordinator and forwarded to MQTT in addition to being sent directly via ZigBee to other devices that have potentially been bound manually (see [Binding](../information/binding.html) for more information).
In its factory reset configuration an ubisys C4 just sends a toggle command (originating from endpoints 1 to 4 respectively) for each input. Therefore basic keypresses on attached momentary switches can be processed through Zigbee2MQTT even without further input configuration.


### Configuring Inputs
The inputs of most ubisys devices can be configured in a very flexible way to map state transitions (e.g. 'released' to
'pressed') to Zigbee commands (e.g. 'toggle'). This even applies to the way in which these inputs control a local load (for ubisys devices other than the C4).

#### Templates
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` using the JSON properties \`configure_device_setup\` and \`input_action_templates\` the inputs can be configured using templates. This allows to configure some common use cases without having to fully dive into the details of \`input_actions\` (see [Raw Configuration](#raw-configuration) below).

Valid template types are:
* \`toggle\`: Use one push button input to toggle the state of a light (or a similar actuator). A 'toggle' command will be sent on every push of the button.
* \`toggle_switch\`: Use one stationary switch to toggle. A 'toggle' command will be sent when the switch is turned on as well as when the switch is turned off.
* \`on_off_switch\`: Use one stationary switch to turn on and off. An 'on' command will be sent when the switch is turned on and an 'off' command when it is turned off. Helpful to ensure that lights stay synchronised when controlling a group.
* \`on\`: Only send an 'on' command on every push of a button. Helpful to e.g. use a C4 as a more direct interface to some other physical device with a relay, e.g. to turn on all lights when the (physical) alarm system signals an intrusion.
* \`off\`: Only send an 'off' command on every push of a button (also see \`on\`).
* \`dimmer_single\`: Use one push button to toggle the state of a light and also to control its level. A short press will send a 'toggle' command and long presses will move the level up and down alternately.
* \`dimmer_double\`: Use two push buttons to switch a light on and off and also to control its level. On the first input, a short press will send an 'on' command and a long press a 'move level up' command. On the second input, a short press will send an 'off' command and a long press a 'move level down' command.
* \`cover\`: Use two push buttons to control a cover. A press on the first input will send a 'move up' command and if released within 1 second, it will send a 'stop' command. The same applies for the second input with 'move down' and 'stop' commands. This allows to use short presses to e.g. control the tilt of lift & tilt blinds whereas long presses will move up or down completely.
* \`cover_switch\`: Use two stationary switches to control a cover. Similar to \`cover\`, but the 'stop' command will always be sent when a switch is turned off.
* \`cover_up\`: Only send a 'move up' command on every push of a button (also see \`on\`).
* \`cover_down\`: Only send a 'move down' command on every push of a button (also see \`on\`).
* \`scene\`: Use a push button to select a scene (using its id). A short press will send a 'recall scene' command using \`scene_id\` and if \`scene_id_2\` is present a long press will do the same using \`scene_id_2\`.
* \`scene_switch\`: Use a stationary switch to select a scene. Very similar to \`scene\`: turning the switch on will send \`scene_id\` and turning it off will send \`scene_id_2\` (if configured).

General attributes:
* \`input\`: Optional, selects the input(s) to use for a template. If not specified, the first template will use input 0 and then it will be incremented automatically for every further template. In case a templates uses two inputs, \`input\` and \`input+1\` will be used and following template will use \`input+2\`.
* \`inputs\`: Optional, selects both inputs separately for templates using two inputs. Allows to e.g. switch up and down inputs in case they are wired differently. The following template will use \`Math.max(...inputs)+1\`.
* \`endpoint\`: Optional, selects the _outbound_ endpoint to use for sending the commands. The C4 only contains _outbound_ endpoints starting with endpoint 1 (see above). For the other ubisys devices endpoint 1 usually is an _inbound_ endpoint controlling the load, but starting at 2 or 3 they also contain _outbound_ endpoints that are per default bound to their respective load controlling endpoint but can also be changed (e.g. from switch to push button) or unbound and rebound to e.g. control a different light using the second input of a S1-R or D1. If not specified, the first template will use the first available _outbound_ endpoint on the specific device and then it will be incremented automatically for every further template. For a C4, cover templates will start at endpoint 5 (since endpoints 1-4 do not host a window covering cluster and can therefore only be used for lights etc).

The input(s) and endpoint used will also be output to the Zigbee2MQTT log (flagged as warnings but only to make sure they do not get suppressed).

Attributes only used with dimmer templates:
* \`no_onoff_down\`: Optional, changes the commands sent to not automatically turn the light off when moving the level fully down. Useful to be able to dim a light down completely without turning it off.
* \`no_onoff_up\`: Optional, changes the commands sent to not automatically turn the light on when moving the level up.
* \`no_onoff\`: Optional, combination of \`no_onoff_up\` and \`no_onoff_down\`.
* \`rate\`: Optional (default is 50), specifies the rate in steps per second when moving the level up or down.

Attributes only used with scene templates
* \`scene_id\`: Mandatory, specifies the scene id to send for the primary function of the template (i.e. short button press or switch turned on).
* \`group_id\`: Specifies the group id to send the 'recall scene' to (needs to be identical to the one used in the group definition in \`configuration.yaml\` / \`groups\` and to the one used when storing the scene. Can be omitted on subsequent scene templates.
* \`scene_id_2\`: Optional, if present it specifies the scene id to send for the secondary function of the template (i.e. long button press or switch turned off).
* \`group_id_2\`: Optional, specifies the group id to send with \`scene_id_2\`. Only needed if different from \`group_id\`.

**On the C4, the respective _outbound_ endpoint also needs to be bound to one or more target devices (see [Binding](#binding) below) for most of the template types (besides scene control).**

Please also note that there seems to be a size limit on the amount of data that can successfully be written using \`input_action_templates\`, so not all combinations theoretically possible will work in reality.

\`"//_comment"\` fields are really just comments only, will be ignored (as any other additional JSON properties) and can certainly be omitted. They are just used here since normal JavaScript comments (\`//\`) would not be considered valid JSON and therefore Zigbee2MQTT would throw an error.

#### Raw Configuration

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` the following device attributes can be set to rawly configure inputs:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_device_setup": {
        "input_configurations": [0, 0, 0, 0],
        "input_actions": [
            [0, 13, 1, 6, 0, 2],
            [1, 13, 2, 6, 0, 2],
            [2, 13, 3, 6, 0, 2],
            [3, 13, 4, 6, 0, 2]
        ]
    }
}
\`\`\`
For further details on these attributes please take a look at the
[ubisys C4 Technical Reference Manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-c4-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.8.5. Device Setup Cluster (Server)" (or the respective ubisys reference manual of the device in use in case it's not a C4) and the "ZigBee Device Physical Input Configurations Integrator's Guide" (which can be obtained directly from ubisys upon request).

Please note that there seems to be a size limit on the amount of data that can successfully be written to \`input_actions\`, so not all configurations theoretically possbile might work in reality.

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get/configure_device_setup\` the values of the configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log.

### Binding
Most of the \`input_actions\` and \`input_action_templates\` (besides scene control) do not reference a target device directly but make use of the binding table of a specific _outbound_ endpoint (for C4 see [General](#general) above, for other ubisys devices take a look at the respective ubisys reference manual). For the C4, Zigbee2MQTT will always bind all endpoints to the coordinator automatically (so Zigbee2MQTT will be able to forward button presses to MQTT), but to control any other ZigBee device or group directly, it is necessary to bind the _outbound_ endpoints used to the target (device or group).

When binding (or unbinding), it is important to explicitly specify the _outbound_ endpoint as the source, e.g. \`zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind\` payload \`{"from": "SOURCE_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/2", "to": "TARGET"}\` (also see [Binding specific endpoint](../information/binding.html#binding-specific-endpoint)). Endpoints can be specified in numeric form and it is usually not necessary to specify an endpoint for the target device.

For ubisys devices other than the C4 this also allows to use the secondary input to control a different device. Example: Use the secondary input on a D1 (uses _outbound_ endpoint 3 in the factory configuration) to control a separate ZigBee bulb:
\`\`\`
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind -m '{"from": "DIMMER_FRIENDLY_NAME/3", "to": "ANOTHER_BULB_FRIENDLY_NAME"}'
\`\`\`

### Decoupling
For ubisys devices other than the C4 this even allows to completely decouple the local input from the local output. Example: Unbind the switch input from the local load and use it to instead control a group of lights without cutting the power to the bulbs (the switch output can still be controlled via ZigBee, e.g. via MQTT through Zigbee2MQTT):
\`\`\`
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/unbind -m '{"from": "SWITCH_FRIENDLY_NAME/2", "to": "SWITCH_FRIENDLY_NAME"}'
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/bind -m '{"from": "SWITCH_FRIENDLY_NAME/2", "to": "GROUP_NAME"}'
\`\`\`

To restore the original behavior you unbind the group and rebind the device:
\`\`\`
mosquitto_pub -t zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/unbind -m '{"from": "SWITCH_FRIENDLY_NAME/2", "to": "GROUP_NAME"}'

### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones or vice versa) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### (Re-)Binding and/or Decoupling
Also see [the ubisys C4 documentation](C4.html#binding), example use cases:
* Use the second input to control a different ZigBee device.
* Completely decouple the input(s) from the local load.

### Ballast Configuration
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` the dimmer's ballast configuration attributes (\`min_level\` and \`max_level\`) can be set.
Example:
\`\`\`json
{
    "ballast_config": {
        "min_level": 3
    }
}
\`\`\`

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get/ballast_config\` the values of the ballast configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log (flagged as warnings but only to make sure they do not get suppressed).
To account for errors due to missing optional attributes (since this is a general function), every cluster attribute will be queried separately and the complete process can therefore take a moment.

### Dimmer strategy configuration
The dimmer phase control mode can be changed by publishing \`{ "mode_phase_control": "MODE" }\` to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` where \`MODE\` is one of the following values: \`automatic\` (default), \`forward\` or \`reverse\`.

A word of caution is in order: configuring the wrong dimmer phase control mode could destroy the device or the attached load!

More information can be found in the [ubisys D1 technical reference manual](https://www.smarthome-store.de/media/documents/ubisys-d1-technical-reference.pdf), chapter "7.2.8. Dimmer Setup Cluster (Server)".

### Transmitters Loosing Connection in ZigBee 3 Networks
With their factory firmware, the transmitters loose network connection after a few hours when ZigBee 3 devices are present in the network (which is a pretty much standard nowadays). For the Jung wall and handheld transmitters there is a firmware update available that fixes this problem (see [OTA updates](#ota-updates) below), but in turn decreases battery lifetime down to a few months.

Unfortunately Gira seems to have dropped support for their ZigBee transmitters completely and does not offer any firmware updates at all. For the Gira handheld transmitter the Jung update seems to work (and to fix the problem), but for the Gira wall transmitter this is not the case (it only has 6 buttons instead of 8 on the Jung wall transmitter and would therefore need a different firmware). There does not seem to be real solution for this problem rendering the Gira wall transmitters pretty much useless nowadays.

### Factory Reset (8-Button Devices)
* Press and hold buttons \`3\` and \`4\` simultaneously for about 10 seconds until the green LEDs start to flash.
* Release buttons \`3\` and \`4\` and then briefly press button \`O\` within 10 seconds.
* The LEDs should light up green for 3 seconds and the transmitter has been reset.
![Reset](../images/InstaRemote-reset.jpg)

### Join Network (8-Button Devices)
* Press and hold buttons \`5\` and \`I\` simultaneously until the green LEDs start to flash. Then release the buttons again.
* After 10 more seconds the transmitter will start to search for an open network in order to join it.
* If the transmitter was able to join a network, the LEDs will light up green for 3 seconds (otherwise the LEDs will flash red quickly for 3 seconds).
![Join Network](../images/InstaRemote-join-network.jpg)

### OTA
For the device to ask for/accept OTA updates, it needs to be in "programming mode" (same mode as for joining a network, see above).
In case the device does still not accept updates or seems to be stuck somehow, it may help to do a factory reset, join the network again and then again enter programming mode before starting the OTA update again.

### Binding
The E1745 can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding).

## Detection cooldown (E1745 version)
This device will pause detection of presence for approximately 1 min 37 sec after detection. In other words; with continuous detection, every 1:37 a new publish (occupancy: true) will be done.
Cooldown of detection is 3 min. In other words; 3 min after last published detection (and trigger no longer present) occupancy will be published as false.

The cooldown detection timeout can be overridden by using the following device config option:
* \`occupancy_timeout\`: Timeout (in seconds) after which the \`occupancy: false\` message is sent.

Please note that setting \`occupancy_timeout\` lower than the device re-trigger time (around 1m30s) means \`occupancy: true\` will only be sent again when motion is detected after the re-trigger time.
This allows an external automation system to observe the detection cycles (detection -> idle -> detection -> idle) and implement more complex automation flows.
For simple automations, setting \`occupancy_timeout\` greater than the re-trigger time is probably desired.

### Pairing
Philips LivingColors IRIS and Philips LivingColors Bloom Devices that comes with
Philips (HUE) Remote Gen 2 (Touch Wheel) or Gen 3 (Round Click Wheel) can be paired via Zigbee.
Devices with Gen 1 Remote don't use Zigbee and can not be paired.
The Philips LivingColors Remote can not be paired via Zigbee because it only support ZigBee Light Link (ZLL).

To Pair hold Button ON and Bottom Left Key (Favorite 1) on the Remote in Front of the Device until
the Device Light blinks and lights Orange. If connection was successful the Device Light will light Green.

**WARNING**: If you pair your Device to a Zigbee Network which is not using a ZLL Channel
you can't reset the Device with the Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 3.
The Gen 3 Remote will only try ZLL Channels to find the Device! Maybe it's possible to reset
the Device with a Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 2 as it should try all Zigbee Channels to find the Device.

With IKEA Tradfri Remote Control it can maybe resetted it this case, see [TRADFRI remote control](#tradfri-remote-control)

### Pairing
Factory resetting a Hue bulb can be accomplished in 5 ways.
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.

#### Touchlink factory reset
See [Touchlink](../information/touchlink)

#### Hue bridge
When the bulb is still connected to the Hue bridge, you can simply factory reset the bulb
by removing it from the bridge via the Hue app. Orphaned bulbs (configured to connect to a non-existing Zigbee network) can be adopted by a Hue bridge by entering the 6 character serial number in the Philips Hue app.

#### Hue dimmer switch
With [one](324131092621) of the [two](929002398602) Hue Dimmer switches it is possible to put the bulbs into a factory reset.

1. Power-supply the bulb
2. Bring the dimmer switch next to the bulb, as close as possible
3. Hold the I/On and 0/Off button pressed simultaneously for 10 to 12 seconds until…
4. The bulb flashes a couple of times. Don't release the buttons until the last flash + a safety second
5. Switch the bulb off and on again: it can now be paired again.

See also the [VIDEO: Factory reset a Hue bulb with Hue dimmer switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlEAELiJKs).

#### Bluetooth (if supported by device)
Install the Philips Hue Bluetooth app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.signify.hue.blue)
or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/philips-hue-bluetooth/id1456604186). You can use the app to trigger a factory reset on a paired light. (Note: The light will only be in bluetooth pairing (Note: The light will only be in bluetooth pairing
mode for a couple of minutes after power-on)

#### TRADFRI remote control
This may also be possible with the
[Tradfri Remote Control](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/tradfri-remote-control__0489469_PE623665_S4.JPG)
by pressing and holding the reset button on the bottom of the remote (next to the battery).

### Power-on behavior
This device allows you to set the power-on behavior. Note that this requires at least November/December '18 firmware update of the device.
Send a MQTT command to [\`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\`](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/mqtt_topics_and_message_structure.html#zigbee2mqttfriendly_nameset) with the following payload.

\`\`\`js
{
    "hue_power_on_behavior": "on",          // default, on, off, recover
    "hue_power_on_brightness": 125,         // same values as brightness
    "hue_power_on_color_temperature": 280,  // same values as color_temp
    "hue_power_on_color": "#0000FF",        // color in hex notation, e.g. #0000FF = blue

}

Attribute Value | Description
----------------|-----------------------------------------------
default         | reset to factory default value
on              | bulb on after power loss with configured brightness, color-temperature and color
off             | bulb off after power loss
recover         | last running state after power loss

Rules:
- \`hue_power_on_behavior\` value always has to be provided
- \`hue_power_on_brightness\`, \`hue_power_on_color_temperature\` and \`hue_power_on_color\` can only be provided when \`hue_power_on_behavior\` = \`on\`
- \`hue_power_on_color_temperature\` and \`hue_power_on_color\` cannot be provided together, only one can be set
- When setting \`hue_power_on_behavior\` = \`on\`, any not provided values will be reset to their factory defaults

Note: if \`hue_power_on_behavior\` is set to \`off\`, then the only way to turn the bulb on will be through a paired smart device (see pairing above). You will NOT be able to turn the bulb on by sequentially switching power on and off.

#### Using the dimmer to reset a Hue light bulb

To use the Hue dimmer switch to factory reset a Hue light bulb see
[HOWTO: Factory reset a Hue bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlEAELiJKs).
After resetting the bulb will automatically connect.
This method also works for Philips Hue Lightstrips.
Hue dimmer switch can also be used to factory reset Ikea Trådfri light bulbs using the same method described above.

### Binding
If you want to bind the dimmer to a (Hue) lamp you'll have to *[bind it to the lamp through MQTT](../information/binding.html)* and unbind it from the coordinator. Use the dimmer as source and a literal \`coordinator\` as target for that.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* \`multiple_press_timeout\`: Controls how long (in seconds) subsequent key presses may be apart and still count as one event. The default is 250ms (0.25).

### Troubleshooting

#### Resetting the device

- Method 1: Press all four buttons for 4 seconds. When the light turns green, release the buttons. The device will flash green and red alternatively after which it will reconnect to the network.
- Method 2: Use a needle or paperclip to press the reset button on the back for 10 seconds. The behavior is similar to method 1

#### Device refuses actions

If actions (e.g. applying zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/remove to a dimmer) result in timeouts, perform a reset (see above) and apply the action right after the device announced itself in the network.

#### Device announces itself but the buttons don't work

The dimmer appears to be working normally and the logs in Zigbee2MQTT look good. However, nothing happens when a button is pressed (no light, no log message in Zigbee2MQTT). In this case:

- Reset the device
- Use zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/remove to remove the device from the network (this should result in a "left the network" log message)
- Allow joining of new devices in Zigbee2MQTT
- Reset the device again
- Wait for it to pair again. The device should now be operational.

group0 = All three leds lit
group1 = first led lit
group2 = second led lit
group3 = third let lit

you can direct bind each remote group with a different Zigbee group, however there is a caveat: the four Zigbee groups have to use consecutive group ids.
The group you will bind (using the frontend or [MQTT command](../information/binding.html)) will be bound to group0 of the remote.
The 3 consecutive groups will be bound to group1 to group3.

This means that you probably should carefully [define your groups id](../information/mqtt_topics_and_message_structure.html#zigbee2mqttbridgeconfigadd_group)  when creating them.

It is possible to bind to a device instead of a group. The device will be bound to group0.
In this case, group0 to group3 will not be usable.

The information below only applies to the legacy integration.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It's worth setting \`debounce\` option with \`debounce_ignore: - action\` to throttle them without losing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)

{% raw %}
\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.5
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
\`\`\`
{% endraw %}

To find optimal "smoothness" play with debounce time or if you need all unique rotation steps consider adding \`brightness\` to \`debounce_ignore\` option

{% raw %}
\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_remote
    debounce: 0.1
    debounce_ignore:
    - action
    - brightness

### Binding
The remote can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding) since firmware 2.3.014.
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time. Use the group name as \`TARGET_DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME\`.
By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
This can be done by sending to \`zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/unbind\` payload \`{"from": "DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME", "to": "default_bind_group"}\`.
Wake up the device right before sending the commands by pressing a button on it.

Once bound to a group/bulb you will notice that the toggle and brightness buttons will work, but scenes/color temperature most likely won't work. This appears to be a missing piece of functionality ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/1232)), but via a workaround this can be managed;
1. Create a group with ID **65289** (name it ie. Trafri_scenes) and add the device(s) you control with the remote.
2. Add/store [scenes](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/scenes.html) for the created group
3. Once you click left/right on the remote, the scenes will be called sequentially (should there be a device off sync in scenes, hold the toggle button for 3 sec.).

#### Note
This device with old firmware < 2.3.014 does not support binding (limitation of the device). A workaround is to first
get the group ID where the remote is sending it's commands to and add bulbs to the
same group ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/782#issuecomment-514526256)).

1. Pair the IKEA TRADFRI remote control to Zigbee2MQTT.
2. Enable debug logging (log_level: debug) ([documentation](../information/configuration.md)).
3. You will get log output like this: \`10/3/2019, 9:28:02 AM - debug: Received Zigbee message from '0x90fd9ffffe90d778'
of type 'commandToggle' with data '{}' from endpoint 1 with groupID 57173\`.
4. Retrieve the group from the log output, which is \`57173\` in the above example.
5. Add this group to \`configuration.yaml\` and add your device (e.g.) bulb to this group.

By default the switch is bound to the coordinator but this device can also be used to directly control other lights and switches in the network.

First unbind it from the coordinator, then you can bind it to any other device or group. (see https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/binding.html )

Now change the operation mode of the device, by default it is in \`event\` mode, but when binding we need to change it to \`command\` mode.
To do this send to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` payload \`{"operation_mode": "command"}\`, right before doing this make sure to wakeup the device.

As the device is sleeping by default, you need to wake it up after sending the bind/unbind command by pressing the reset button once.

### Troubleshooting: device stops sending messages/disconnects from network
Since Xiaomi devices do not fully comply to the Zigbee standard, it sometimes happens that they disconnect from the network.
Most of the times this happens because of the following reasons:
- Device has a weak signal, you can see the signal quality in the published messages as \`linkquality\`. A linkquality < 20 is considered weak.
- Low battery voltage, this can even happen when the battery still appears full. Try a different battery.
- The device is connected through a router which cannot deal with Xiaomi devices. This is known to happen devices from: Centralite, General Electric, Iris, Ledvance, OSRAM, Sylvania, SmartThings, Securifi.

delays in the network the release message is received late. This causes a single
click to be identified as a \`hold\` action. If you are experiencing this you can try
experimenting with this option (e.g. \`hold_timeout: 2000\`).
* \`hold_timeout_expire\`: Sometimes it happens that the button does not send a release. To avoid problems Zigbee2MQTT expires the \`hold\` leading to no \`release\` being send. The default timeout is 4000 ms, you can increase it with this option.

### Green Power
This is a Zigbee Green Power device which allows it to be very energy efficient.
Messages from Green Power devices cannot be "understood" by normal Zigbee devices, therefore they need to be "translated" first.
Not all Zigbee devices can do this translation, currently the only devices known to do this are Philips Hue devices. This means that the Green Power device has to be in range of a Philips Hue device in order to use it.

Green Power devices don't support binding and are not included in network scans.

### Pairing Philips Hue Tap
This device requires your Zigbee network to run on channel 11, 15, 20 or 25. In order to pair it hold the corresponding button for that channel 10 seconds.

| Button (dots) | Channel |
|-|-|
| 1 | 11 |
| 2 | 15 |
| 3 | 20 |
| 4 | 25 |

### Pairing Friends of Hue switches (EnOcean PTM 216Z module based)
This device has 4 buttons: A0 (left-top), A1 (left-bottom), B0 (right-top), B1 (right-bottom). In case the module is integrated in a single rocker switch, you need to remove the caps to expose all buttons. A button can be pressed by holding the contact of that button and then push the energy bar.

To pair it hold the corresponding button for that channel for 7 seconds or more.

| Button | Channel |
|-|-|
| A0 | 15 |
| A1 | 20 |
| B0 | 11 |
| B1 | 25 |

Once the device is paired you need to confirm the channel. To do this press A1 and B0 together. Important: don't press any other buttons between this and the pairing.

In case you want to pair it to a different channel you have to factory reset the device. This can be done by pressing all buttons (A0, A1, B0 and B1) simultaneously for at least 7 seconds.

This device can work on any channel, not only 15, 20, 11 or 25. For this refer to the [EnOcean PTM 216Z manual chapter 5.3](https://www.enocean.com/en/products/enocean_modules_24ghz/ptm-216z/user-manual-pdf/)

### Local temperature
If you'd like to force device to send local_temperature you can use this MQTT command:
* \`topic\`: zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set/local_temperature_calibration
* \`payload\`: YOUR_CURRENT_CALIBRATION_VALUE

YOUR_CURRENT_CALIBRATION_VALUE can be 0, but if you calibrated temperature for this device send current value.
After this command thermostat responds with two messages. One for calibration change confirmation, and other with current local_temperature.

### Controlling device specific features

            {"hour":23,"minute":30,"temperature":15}
        ]
    }
    \`\`\`
- You can set "week" schedule pattern with topic \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\`. The payload values are:
  5+2 -> to be used when workdays for example are monday-friday and saturday & sunday are holidays
  6+1 -> to be used when workdays for example are monday-saturday and sunday is a holiday
  7 -> to be used when workdays schedule will be used for the whole week

### Configuration of device attributes
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` various device attributes can be configured:
\`\`\`json
{
    "options":{
        "reverse_direction": xxx,
        "hand_open": xxx,
        "reset_limits": xxx
    }
}
\`\`\`

- **reverse_direction**: (\`true\`/\`false\`, default: \`false\`). Device can be configured to act in an opposite direction.
- **hand_open**: (\`true\`/\`false\`, default: \`true\`). By default motor starts rotating when you pull the curtain by hand. You can disable this behaviour.
- **reset_limits**: (\`true\`/\`false\`, default: \`false\`). Reset the motor. When a path was cleared from obstacles.

You can send a subset of options, all options that won't be specified will be revered to default.

After changing \`reverse_direction\` you will need to fully open and fully close the curtain so the motor will re-detect edges. \`reverse_direction\` will get new state only after this recalibration.

### Lost configuration on long power outage
If motor is used without battery it may lose configuration after long power outage. In that case you need to perform end stops calibration again publishing the following command sequence with topic \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\`:
1. \`{ "options": { "reset_limits": true } }\`
2. \`{ "state": "close" }\`
3. Wait here for curtain closure.
4. \`{ "state": "open" }\`

Home Assistant automation example:
\`\`\`yaml
- alias: Calibrate curtain
  trigger:
  - platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set
      payload: "{ 'options': { 'reset_limits': true } }"
  - service: cover.close_cover
    entity_id: cover.<COVER_ID>
  - delay:
      seconds: 13 #wait for closure complete
  - service: cover.open_cover
    entity_id: cover.<COVER_ID>
\`\`\`

Motor leaves calibration mode automatically after it reaches the both open and close curtain position limits. Calibration is mandatory for proper position reporting and ability to set intermediate positions.

### Pairing
If you are having trouble pairing, reset the device.
- Make sure the device is on auto or heat mode (not off). Hold boost, +, and - (a count from 1 to 10 will be on the display, it may be required for the thermostat to be dismounted from the radiator valve for this to work)
- release once 'rES' is displayed
- hit boot once after 'Jin' is displayed to start pairing to the ZigBee network
- once successfully paired 'Ins' should be displayed and the boost button should flash green. Make sure the thermostat is mounted on the radiator valve before pressing the boost button again.
- now the display should read 'Ada' indicating the adapting process is started which should mechanically calibrate the thermostat to the valve.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It’s worth setting debounce option to throttle them without losing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)


\`\`\`yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_device
    debounce: 0.5

The system mode will be either \`off\`, \`auto\`, or \`heat\`. When set to \`heat\` the boost host flags will be set, when using \`off\` the window_open host flag will be set (and off will be displayed on the display).

*Eurotronic host flags*

The \`eurotronic_host_flags\` property contains an object with a true/false field for each host option.

\`\`\`json
{
  "eurotronic_host_flags": {
    "mirror_display": false,
    "boost": false,
    "window_open": false,
    "child_protection": true
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can toggle these flags by publishing a message to the \`set\` MQTT topic containing \`eurotronic_host_flags\`. e.g. enabling the display mirroring:
\`\`\`json
{"eurotronic_host_flags": {"mirror_display": true}}
\`\`\`

**Note that \`true\` or \`false\` do not have quotes aroud them!**

*Eurotronic system mode*

**This is deprecated in favor of eurotronic_host_flags, but will still work for now.**

This is a bitmap encoded field to set several device specific features. Please remind it is not possible to set single bits, always the full bitmap is written. Bit 0 doesn't seem to be writeable, it is always reported as set, so expect your written value + 1 to be reported.

Bit | Position
--- | --------
0 | unknown (default 1)
1 | Mirror display
2 | Boost
3 | unknown
4 | disable window open
5 | set window open (is reported as disable window open)
6 | unknown
7 | Child protection

Examples for eurotronic_system_mode:

Mirror display, reported as 3
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 2
}
\`\`\`
signal external window open, current_heating_setpoint will report "5", device display shows "OFF"
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 32
}
\`\`\`
signal external window close, will restore last current_heating_setpoint value
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 16
}
\`\`\`
Mirror display and set child protection.
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 66
}
\`\`\`

*Eurotronic error status*
\`\`\`json
{
    "eurotronic_error_status": 0
}
\`\`\`
This field is a readonly bitmap

Bit | Position
--- | --------
0 | reserved
1 | reserved

### Configuring Inputs
In case the inputs need to be reconfigured (e.g. to use stationary switches instead of momentary ones or vice versa) this can be done in the same way as [it is being done for the ubisys C4](C4.html#configuring-inputs).

### Configuration of device attributes
By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` various device attributes can be configured:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_j1": {
        "windowCoveringType": xxx,
        "configStatus": xxx,
        "installedOpenLimitLiftCm": xxx,
        "installedClosedLimitLiftCm": xxx,
        "installedOpenLimitTiltDdegree": xxx,
        "installedClosedLimitTiltDdegree": xxx,
        "turnaroundGuardTime": xxx,
        "liftToTiltTransitionSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps": xxx,
        "liftToTiltTransitionSteps2": xxx,
        "totalSteps2": xxx,
        "additionalSteps": xxx,
        "inactivePowerThreshold": xxx,
        "startupSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps": xxx,
        "totalSteps2": xxx
    }
}
\`\`\`
For further details on these attributes please take a look at the
[ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5. Window Covering Cluster (Server)".

As an alternative to the attributes listed above, the following properties may be used for convenience:
* \`open_to_closed_s\`: corresponds to \`totalSteps\`, but takes value in seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`closed_to_open_s\`: ditto for \`totalSteps2\`,
* \`lift_to_tilt_transition_ms\`: sets both \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps\` and \`liftToTiltTransitionSteps2\`
(they shall both be equal according to ubisys manual), but takes value in *milli*seconds instead of in full AC waves
* \`steps_per_second\`: factor to be used for conversion, defaults to 50 full AC waves per second if not provided

By publishing to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get/configure_j1\` the values of the configuration attributes can
also be read back from the device and be printed to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log.

### Calibration
By publishing \`{"configure_j1": {"calibrate": 1}}\` to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\` the device can also be
calibrated after installation to support more advanced positioning features
(i.e. go to lift percentage / go to tilt percentage). This can be combined with setting attributes as shown above,
for example:
\`\`\`json
{
    "configure_j1": {
        "calibrate" : 1,
        "windowCoveringType": 8,
        "lift_to_tilt_transition_ms": 1600
    }
}
\`\`\`
The calibration procedure will move the shutter up and down several times and the current stage of the
calibration process will again be logged to the normal Zigbee2MQTT log for the user to get some feedback.
For details on the calibration procedure please again take a look at
the [ubisys J1 technical reference manual](https://www.ubisys.de/wp-content/uploads/ubisys-j1-technical-reference.pdf),
chapter "7.2.5.1. Calibration".
Please note that tilt transition steps cannot be determined automatically and must therefore be
configured manually for the device to also support "go to tilt percentage". One possibility to determine the
correct value is to take a video of the blinds moving from 0 to 100 percent tilt and then getting the exact timing
from the video by playing it slow motion.

### Home Assistant cover features when using [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant)
The cover will be offered to Home Assistant as supporting lift and tilt by default, but for covers with reduced
functionality this can be passed along to Home Assistant by disabling some of the topics in \`configuration.yaml\`,
for example:
\`\`\`yaml
'0x001fee0000001234':
    friendly_name: cover_not_supporting_tilt'
    homeassistant:
      tilt_command_topic: null
      tilt_status_topic: null
'0x001fee0000001234':
    friendly_name: cover_supporting_neither_lift_nor_tilt'
    homeassistant:
    set_position_topic: null
    position_topic: null
      tilt_command_topic: null
      tilt_status_topic: null

### Pairing
Factory reset the Lutron Connected Bulb Remote by pressing and holding the remote's top and bottom buttons for approximately 15 seconds. The light on the remote will blink rapidly to indicate that the remote has been reset.

After resetting the remote can be paired to a network by pressing and holding the top button for approximately 2 seconds.

#### Using the Connected Bulb Remote to reset a connected light bulb (Hue, Cree, GE Link)
Connected light bulbs can be reset with the Lutron Connected Bulb Remote by bringing the remote close (~3 inches) to the light bulb and pressing and holding the remote's 2nd and bottom buttons. The light bulb will flash and the remote's LED will turn on. Continue to hold both buttons until the remote's LED turns off.

After resetting the bulb will automatically attempt to join a network.

This method should work for Philips Hue bulbs, IKEA TRADFRI bulbs, GE Link bulbs, Connected Cree bulbs, and EcoSmart SMART bulbs.

### Pairing

Press the side button of the device with a paper clip for more than 2 seconds. The main button led will flash. Then make sure the device is awake during pairing phase or the configuration may fail. To ensure device is awake press the main button every 2 seconds until configuration is done in Zigbee2MQTT logs.

### Important
There are 3 versions of this device: Standalone, Zigbee and Z-wave. These are visually identical. Make sure to get the correct version that will work with Zigbee2MQTT:

Supported:
- **HS1SA-M : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-N : Zigbee**
- **HS1SA-E : Zigbee 3.0**

Unsupported:
- HS1SA : Standalone
- HS1SA-Z : Z-wave

The product code should end in *-M* for the Zigbee version. The label inside the battery compartment should also show the Zigbee logo.

        note: `
### Device pairing/installation
To put the TRV in installation mode twist and hold the cap in the  **+** direction
until the central LED flashes green.  The device is ready for joining when:

- left/right LEDs flash red/blue
- central LED shows a solid orange

If central light shows a solid green, your TRV has been paired and is connected to the zigbee network.

If blinking with yellow, then your TRV is not paired or can't connect to the zigbee network. If Zigbee2MQTT is running and accepting new devices the valve should join the network. Sometimes you may need to twist and hold the cap in the **+** direction for 3 seconds before it will try to join.

**Note:** Zigbee2MQTT might not be able to correctly configure the TRV until you have [calibrated](#calibrate) it.

If the valve is not recognized, you can turn the boost button to positive and hold it; the red light starts to blink slowly. Release the button once the red light stops blinking.

### Calibrate
After installing the TRV twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold for
2 seconds until the blue LED lights up.

### Device hard reset
If the device fails to pair/join the network (\`red:yellow:blue\` on pairing mode) or you changed the network id/channel, connect to another network, bought the TRV second hand, you can perform a factory reset to start fresh.

1. Make sure that the TRV is NOT in pairing mode.
2. Twist the cap in the **-** direction and hold till blue light turns off and then center light blinks red (about 15 seconds).
3. Release the button, you should see a \`red:green:blue\` short flash; the valve will go into installation mode.

### Controlling

Valve sometimes fails to respond/acknowledge a setting, just send the command again.

- Get local temperature in degrees Celsius.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "local_temperature": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get or set occupied heating setpoint to *&lt;temperature&gt;* in degrees Celsius. Possible values: 7 to 30 by default; leave empty to read.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "occupied_heating_setpoint": "<temperature>"
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get or set the keypad lock, i.e. enable/disable twist-top boost. Possible values: "unlock", "lock1". **WARNING** Setting the keypad to lock (i.e. "lock1") disables the twist-top boost button which impedes setting the valve to installation mode or hard-reseting it.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "keypad_lockout": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the battery level, in percentage. Possible values 0 to 100 (%). The level corresponds voltages in the range 2.2 V (0%) to 3.0 V (100%). The levels where chosen so a 0% indicates that batteries must be replaced, but the valve will still work.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "battery": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

- Get the battery voltage. Possible values 0.0 to 3.0 (V). This is a direct measure of the battery voltage.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "voltage": ""
    }

- Get the (latest) twist-top boost state. Possible values:

    | Attribute Value | Description |
    | -----------------|----------------------------------------------- |
    | 1 | Boost up |
    | 0 | No boost |
    | -1 | Boost down |

    Note that the valve will not automatically toggle the value to 0 after some time, i.e. configuration/automation logic is needed to use the value. E.g. in Home Assistant the \`expire_after\` setting can be used to handle this.

- Get the valve position / heating demand. Will report the valve position or heating amount depending. Possible values 0 to 100 (%).
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "pi_heating_demand": ""
    }

- Get the valve motor state. Possible values: "Stall", others. String description of the motor state. Seems to change when the motor is moving.
    \`\`\`json
    {
        "MOT": ""
    }
    \`\`\`

### Setting outdoor temperature
To set _outdoor temperature_, you need to send the value to the following MQTT topic:
\`\`\`
zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature
\`\`\`

If you want to automate the publishing of the outdoor temperature using Home Assistant, you may create an automation like this:

\`\`\` yaml
- id: auto_publish_outdoor_temp
  description: publish the outdoor temperature to Stelpro thermostat
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.outdoor_sensor_temperature
      condition: []
  action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data_template:
      payload: '{{ states(trigger.entity_id) }}'
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/THERMOSTAT_FRIENDLY_NAME/set/thermostat_outdoor_temperature'
\`\`\`

**IMPORTANT**: The outdoor temperature need to be refreshed at least each 4 hours, or the \`EXT\` display will be cleared on the thermostat.

## OpenHAB integration and configuration
In OpenHAB you need the MQTT Binding to be installed. It is possible to add this sensor as a generic MQTT thing, but here it is described how to add the sensor manually via an editor.

To make the following configuration work it is necessary to enable the experimental attribute output in the configuration.yaml.
\`\`\`yaml
experimental:
    output: attribute
\`\`\`

### Thing
To add this Xiaomi MCCGQ01LM MiJia door & window contact sensor as Thing it is necessary to embed the Thing into a bridge definition of a MQTT broker. Please consider that for the door window sensor OPEN is false (no contact) and CLOSED is true (contact). So make sure that on(OPEN) = "false" and off(CLOSED) = "true".

\`\`\`yaml
Bridge mqtt:broker:zigbeeBroker [ host="YourHostname", secure=false, username="your_username", password="your_password" ]
{
    Thing topic MijiaDoorSensor "MiJia door & window contact sensor"  @ "Your room"
    {
        Channels:
            Type contact  : status      "status"      [ stateTopic = "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/contact", on="false", off="true" ]

            /****************************************************************************************************
            If you want to know when the sensor has been last changed you can add to your configuration.yaml:
            advanced:
                last_seen: ISO_8601_local

            and add another channel:

### Model numbers
In Legrand, model number depends on the country and the colour of the devices, for instance:

- French models are branded as Céliane with Netatmo, whereas Spanish models are branded as Legrand Valena Next. However, this device has no colour options, so there is only one model: "412015" or "4 120 15"

Other brand names depending on the country:
- Availability for Céliane™ with Netatmo &#8594;     France and Overseas territories, Greece, Poland, Hungary, Tunisia, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Czech Republic, Russia, Mauritius

### Force read power
* \`power\`: Asks the device for the current active power.

Example of MQTT message payload to ask for the active power. This should be sent to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get\`:

\`\`\`js
{
    "power"
}
\`\`\`


### Power Alarm Configuration
* \`power_alarm\`: enables or disables the power alarm, and sets the value: \`DISABLE\` (default) / \`integer\` (in kWh)

Example of MQTT message payload to disable the power alarm. This should be sent to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\`:

\`\`\`js
{
    "power_alarm": "DISABLE"
}
\`\`\`

Example of MQTT message payload to enable the power alarm at 3.3 kWh. This should be sent to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\`:

\`\`\`js
{
    "power_alarm": "3300"
}
\`\`\`

When it reaches that value, the \`power_alarm_active\` binary_sensor will change to \`true\`.


### Identify
Helps to identify the device using the LED.

* \`identify['effect']\`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in \`effect\`. Values:
    - \`blink3\`
    - \`fixed\`
    - \`blinkgreen\`
    - \`blinkblue\`

* \`identify['color']\`:  only works for blink3 & fixed in \`effect\`. Values:
    - \`default\`
    - \`red\`
    - \`green\`
    - \`blue\`
    - \`lightblue\`
    - \`yellow\`
    - \`pink\`
    - \`white\`

Example of MQTT message payload to Identify the device. This should be sent to \`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set\`:

\`\`\`js
{
    "identify": {
    "effect": "blink3",
    "color": "white"
    }
}
\`\`\`
`,
    },
    {
        model: ['RTCGQ01LM', 'RTCGQ11LM'],
        note: `
* \`no_occupancy_since\`: Timeout (in seconds) after which \`no_occupancy_since\` is sent.
This indicates the time since the last occupancy was detected.
For example \`no_occupancy_since: [10, 60]\` will send a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 10}\` after 10 seconds
and a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 60}\` after 60 seconds.
* \`occupancy_timeout\`: Timeout (in seconds) after which the \`occupancy: false\` message is sent.
If not set, the timeout is \`90\` seconds.
When set to \`0\` no \`occupancy: false\` is sent.

**IMPORTANT**: \`occupancy_timeout\` should not be set to lower than 60 seconds.
The reason is this: after detecting a motion the sensor ignores any movements for
exactly 60 seconds. In case there are movements after this 60 seconds, a new message
(\`occupancy: true\`) will be sent and the sensor will go to sleep for another minute, and so on.
Therefore, in order to sustain \`occupancy: true\`, you need a reasonable window after this 60s sleep
to determine continued occupancy.
This is expected behaviour (see [#270](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/270#issuecomment-414999973)).
To work around this, a
[hardware modification](https://community.smartthings.com/t/making-xiaomi-motion-sensor-a-super-motion-sensor/139806)
is needed.

### Pairing

Pairing may differ per model (TS0043 also comes as white-label device such as the LoraTap SS600ZB).

#### LoraTap SS600ZB:

Open the shell of the remote (remove the screw at the back first).
Press the pairing button on the PCB for 5-10 seconds until the yellow
indicator light flashes, then release it.
While pairing, keep the remote close to the coordinator.
