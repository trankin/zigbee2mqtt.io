## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.


* `simulated_brightness`: Set to `true` to simulate a `brightness` value (default: `false`).
If this device provides a `brightness_move_up` or `brightness_move_down` action it is possible to specify the update
interval and delta. This can be done by instead of specifying `true`:

```yaml
simulated_brightness:
  delta: 20 # delta per interval, default = 20
  interval: 200 # interval in milliseconds, default = 200
```

## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `Â°C`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `recall_1`, `recall_2`, `recall_3`, `recall_4`, `on`, `off`, `brightness_move_down`, `brightness_move_up`, `brightness_stop`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
