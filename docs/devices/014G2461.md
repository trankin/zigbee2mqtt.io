## Notes


### Pairing
* Install the device on the valve. Insert the batteries (and M will display).
* Push the "o" button for 5 seconds to calibrate the valve motor.
* Push the "o" button for briefly to enter Pairing mode (can take upto 60 seconds).

To factory reset:
* Remove one battery.
* Press and hold "o" button.
* Insert battery and hold button pressed for about 3 seconds (display will flash all symbols).

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `false` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!) (default: true)


## OTA updates
