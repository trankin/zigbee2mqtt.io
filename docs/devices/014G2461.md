## Notes


### Pairing
* Install the device on the valve. Insert the batteries (and M will display).
* Push the "o" button for 5 seconds to calibrate the valve motor.
* Push the "o" button for briefly to enter Pairing mode (can take upto 60 seconds).

To factory reset:
* Remove one battery.
* Press and hold "o" button.
* Insert battery and hold button pressed for about 3 seconds (display will flash all symbols).

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `false` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!) (default: true)


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Keypad_lockout (binary)
Enables/disables physical input on the device.
Value can be found in the published state on the `keypad_lockout` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"keypad_lockout": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"keypad_lockout": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `lock1` keypad_lockout is ON, if `unlock` OFF.

### Mounted_mode (binary)
Mode in which the unit is mounted. This is set to `false` for normal mounting or `true` for vertical mounting.
Value can be found in the published state on the `mounted_mode` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` mounted_mode is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Heat_required (binary)
Wether or not the unit needs warm water.
Value can be found in the published state on the `heat_required` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` heat_required is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Window_open_internal (binary)
0=Quarantine, 1=Windows are closed, 2=Hold - Windows are maybe about to open, 3=Open window detected, 4=In window open state from external but detected closed locally.
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_open_internal` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `1` window_open_internal is ON, if `0` OFF.

### Setpoint_change_source (binary)
Values observed are `0` (set locally) or `2` (set via Zigbee).
Value can be found in the published state on the `setpoint_change_source` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `0` setpoint_change_source is ON, if `1` OFF.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `pi_heating_demand`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `6` and `28`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.

### Window_open_external (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_open_external` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"window_open_external": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"window_open_external": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` window_open_external is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Day_of_week (numeric)
Exercise day of week: 0=Sun...6=Sat, 7=undefined.
Value can be found in the published state on the `day_of_week` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"day_of_week": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"day_of_week": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `7`.

### Trigger_time (numeric)
Exercise trigger time. Minutes since midnight (65535=undefined).
Value can be found in the published state on the `trigger_time` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"trigger_time": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"trigger_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `65535`.

### Heat_available (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the `heat_available` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"heat_available": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"heat_available": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` heat_available is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Algorithm_scale_factor (numeric)

manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
