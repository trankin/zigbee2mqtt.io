## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.


* `humidity_precision`: Controls the precision of `humidity` values, e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the humidity value set it to e.g. `{80: 0, 10: 1}`,
when humidity >= 80 precision will be 0, when humidity >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.

## Exposes

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `Â°C`.

### Humidity (numeric)
Measured relative humidity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Co2 (numeric)
The measured CO2 (carbon dioxide) value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `co2` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppm`.

### Voc (numeric)
Measured VOC value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voc` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppb`.

### Formaldehyd (numeric)
The measured formaldehyd value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `formaldehyd` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
