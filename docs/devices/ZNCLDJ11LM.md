## Notes


### Pairing
Hold button for a few seconds until red light turn on.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `invert_cover`: By default the position/tilt values mean: open = 100, closed = 0. This can be inverted by setting this option to true (so open = 0, close = 100).


### Configuration of device attributes
By publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` various device attributes can be configured:
```json
{
    "options":{
        "reverse_direction": xxx,
        "hand_open": xxx,
        "reset_limits": xxx
    }
}
```

- **reverse_direction**: (`true`/`false`, default: `false`). Device can be configured to act in an opposite direction.
- **hand_open**: (`true`/`false`, default: `true`). By default motor starts rotating when you pull the curtain by hand. You can disable this behaviour.
- **reset_limits**: (`true`/`false`, default: `false`). Reset the motor. When a path was cleared from obstacles.

You can send a subset of options, all options that won't be specified will be revered to default.

After changing `reverse_direction` you will need to fully open and fully close the curtain so the motor will re-detect edges. `reverse_direction` will get new state only after this recalibration.

### Lost configuration on long power outage
If motor is used without battery it may lose configuration after long power outage. In that case you need to perform end stops calibration again publishing the following command sequence with topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`:
1. `{ "options": { "reset_limits": true } }`
2. `{ "state": "close" }`
3. Wait here for curtain closure.
4. `{ "state": "open" }`

Home Assistant automation example:
```yaml
- alias: Calibrate curtain
  trigger:
  - platform: homeassistant
    event: start
  action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set
      payload: "{ 'options': { 'reset_limits': true } }"
  - service: cover.close_cover
    entity_id: cover.<COVER_ID>
  - delay:
      seconds: 13 #wait for closure complete
  - service: cover.open_cover
    entity_id: cover.<COVER_ID>
```

Motor leaves calibration mode automatically after it reaches the both open and close curtain position limits. Calibration is mandatory for proper position reporting and ability to set intermediate positions.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes

### Cover 
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "OPEN"}` or `{"state": "CLOSE"}`.
To read the current state of this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
cover:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    position_template: "{{ value_json.position }}"
    set_position_template: "{ \"position\": {{ position }} }"
    set_position_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>/set"
    position_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    icon: "mdi:signal"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:update"
    value_template: "{{ value_json['update']['state'] }}"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    value_template: "{{ value_json.update_available}}"
```
{% endraw %}
