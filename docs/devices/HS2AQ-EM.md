## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


* `humidity_precision`: Controls the precision of `humidity` values, e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the humidity value set it to e.g. `{80: 0, 10: 1}`,
when humidity >= 80 precision will be 0, when humidity >= 10 precision will be 1.



## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Humidity (numeric)
Measured relative humidity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Pm25 (numeric)
Measured PM2.5 (particulate matter) concentration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `pm25` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `µg/m³`.

### Hcho (numeric)
Measured Hcho value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `hcho` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `mg/m³`.

### Voc (numeric)
Measured VOC value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voc` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppb`.

### Aqi (numeric)
Air quality index.
Value can be found in the published state on the `aqi` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Pm10 (numeric)
Measured PM10 (particulate matter) concentration.
Value can be found in the published state on the `pm10` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `µg/m³`.

### Battery_state (enum)
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `not_charging`, `charging`, `charged`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
