### Schedule (composite)
Schedule will work with "auto" preset. In this mode, the device executes a preset week programming temperature time and temperature. Before using these properties, check `working_day` property. Each day can contain up to 10 segments. At least 1 segment should be defined. Different count of segments can be defined for each day, e.g., 3 segments for Monday, 5 segments for Thursday, etc. It should be defined in the following format: `hours:minutes/temperature`. Minutes can be only tens, i.e., 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Segments should be divided by space symbol. Each day should end with the last segment of 24:00. Examples: `04:00/20 08:30/22 10:10/18 18:40/24 22:50/19.5`; `06:00/21.5 17:20/26 24:00/18`. The temperature will be set from the beginning/start of one period and until the next period, e.g., `04:00/20 24:00/22` means that from 00:00 to 04:00 temperature will be 20 degrees and from 04:00 to 00:00 temperature will be 22 degrees..
