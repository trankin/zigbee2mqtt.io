| Description | TRADFRI open/close remote |
| Exposes | battery, action, linkquality |

## Notes


### Deprecated click event
By default this device exposes a deprecated `click` event. It's recommended to use the `action` event instead.

To disable the `click` event, set `legacy: false` for this device in `configuration.yaml`. Example:

```yaml
devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: my_device
    legacy: false
```


### Pairing
Pair the switch to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button (found under the back cover next to the battery)
4 times in a row. The red light on the front side should flash a few times and then turn off
(it's more visible to see the light from the back). After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate.
When connected, the light turns off.

### Binding
The E1766 can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding).
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time and cannot be bound to a device.

By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from.
This can be done by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/unbind` payload `{"from": "DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME", "to": "default_bind_group"}`.
Right before executing the commands make sure to wake up the device by pressing a button on it.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `legacy`: Set to `false` to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended!) (default: true)


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `close`, `open`, `stop`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: "mdi:toggle-switch"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.click }}"

    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
