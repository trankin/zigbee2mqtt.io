# Lidl HG06335

| Model | HG06335  |
| Vendor  | Lidl  |
| Description | Silvercrest smart motion sensor |
| Exposes | occupancy, battery_low, tamper, battery, linkquality |
| Picture | ![Lidl HG06335](../images/devices/HG06335.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the motion detector by holding the reset button (little hole on the right side, **not the button on the back**) for 5 seconds.
When you let go of the button an LED should blink.
After resetting the motion detector will automatically connect.
While pairing, keep the motion detector close to the adapter.
Press the tamper button a few times while pairing to keep the sensor a wake.

### Tamper
If the button on the back is pressed (i.e. the device is on the mounting plate), the value of `tamper` equals `true` otherwise it is `false`.



## Exposes

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Tamper (binary)
Indicates whether the device is tampered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tamper` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` tamper is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
