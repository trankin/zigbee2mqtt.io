## Notes


### Pairing
Pair the sensor to Zigbee2MQTT by pressing the pair button 4 times in a row.
The red light on the front side should flash a few times and then turn off.
After a few seconds it turns back on and pulsate. When connected, the light turns off.

### Binding
The E1745 can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding).

## Detection cooldown (E1745 version)
This device will pause detection of presence for approximately 1 min 37 sec after detection. In other words; with continuous detection, every 1:37 a new publish (occupancy: true) will be done.
Cooldown of detection is 3 min. In other words; 3 min after last published detection (and trigger no longer present) occupancy will be published as false.

The cooldown detection timeout can be overridden by using the following device config option:
* `occupancy_timeout`: Timeout (in seconds) after which the `occupancy: false` message is sent.

Please note that setting `occupancy_timeout` lower than the device re-trigger time (around 1m30s) means `occupancy: true` will only be sent again when motion is detected after the re-trigger time.
This allows an external automation system to observe the detection cycles (detection -> idle -> detection -> idle) and implement more complex automation flows.
For simple automations, setting `occupancy_timeout` greater than the re-trigger time is probably desired.


## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../information/ota_updates.md).


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Requested_brightness_level (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_level` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `76` and the maximum value is `254`.

### Requested_brightness_percent (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `requested_brightness_percent` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `30` and the maximum value is `100`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
