# Xiaomi A6121

| Model | A6121  |
| Vendor  | Xiaomi  |
| Description | Vima Smart Lock |
| Exposes | inserted, linkquality |
| Picture | ![Xiaomi A6121](../images/devices/A6121.jpg) |

## Notes

### Remote unlock
Be aware that this smart does not offer remote unlock. Users will need the special keys it provides. You can then disable access for these keys, but this requires the app. In essence Zigbee2MQTT only provides the ability to know when a key was inserted.


## Exposes

### Inserted (text)
Value can be found in the published state on the `inserted` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.inserted }}"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
```
{% endraw %}
