# Konke TW-S1

| Model | TW-S1  |
| Vendor  | Konke  |
| Description | Photoelectric smoke detector |
| Exposes | smoke, battery_low, linkquality |
| Picture | ![Konke TW-S1](../images/devices/TW-S1.jpg) |

## Notes


### Important
Konke devices only work on Zigbee channel 15, 20 and 25.



## Exposes

### Smoke (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected smoke.
Value can be found in the published state on the `smoke` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` smoke is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:


{% raw %}
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.smoke }}"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    device_class: "smoke"

binary_sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.battery_low }}"
    payload_on: true
    payload_off: false
    device_class: "battery"

sensor:
  - platform: "mqtt"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME>"
    availability_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.linkquality }}"
    unit_of_measurement: "lqi"
    icon: "mdi:signal"
```
{% endraw %}
