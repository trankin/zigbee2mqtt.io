# Xiaomi SJCGQ11LM

| Model | SJCGQ11LM  |
| Vendor  | Xiaomi  |
| Description | Aqara water leak sensor |
| Exposes | battery, water_leak, battery_low, voltage, linkquality |
| Picture | ![Xiaomi SJCGQ11LM](../images/devices/SJCGQ11LM.jpg) |

## Notes


### Pairing
Press and hold water logo on the device for +- 10 seconds (you have to press quite hard) until the blue light blinks
three times, release the water logo (the blue light will blink once more) and wait.
    


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Water_leak (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected a water leak.
Value can be found in the published state on the `water_leak` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` water_leak is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Voltage (numeric)
Voltage of the battery in millivolts.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `mV`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
