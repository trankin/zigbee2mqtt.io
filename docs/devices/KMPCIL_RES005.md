### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_lux_precision`: Controls the precision of `illuminance_lux` values, e.g. `0` or `1`; default `1`.
To control the precision based on the illuminance_lux value set it to e.g. `{1000: 0, 100: 1}`,
when illuminance_lux >= 1000 precision will be 0, when illuminance_lux >= 100 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.


* `illuminance_lux_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate illuminance values,
e.g. `95` would take 95% to the illuminance reported by the device; default `100`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.


* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.


* `humidity_precision`: Controls the precision of `humidity` values, e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the humidity value set it to e.g. `{80: 0, 10: 1}`,
when humidity >= 80 precision will be 0, when humidity >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.


* `pressure_precision`: Controls the precision of `pressure` values, e.g. `0` or `1`; default `1`.
To control the precision based on the pressure value set it to e.g. `{1000: 0, 100: 1}`,
when pressure >= 1000 precision will be 0, when pressure >= 100 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `pressure_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate pressure values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 to the pressure reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.

## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `Â°C`.

### Humidity (numeric)
Measured relative humidity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Pressure (numeric)
The measured atmospheric pressure.
Value can be found in the published state on the `pressure` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `hPa`.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Raw measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Illuminance_lux (numeric)
Measured illuminance in lux.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_lux` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
