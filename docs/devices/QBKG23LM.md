# Xiaomi QBKG23LM

| Model | QBKG23LM  |
| Vendor  | Xiaomi  |
| Description | Aqara D1 1 gang smart wall switch (with neutral wire) |
| Exposes | switch (state), power, energy, temperature, voltage, action, linkquality |
| Picture | ![Xiaomi QBKG23LM](../images/devices/QBKG23LM.jpg) |

## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`.


### Decoupled mode
Decoupled mode allows to turn wired switch into wireless button with separately controlled relay.
This might be useful to assign some custom actions to buttons and control relay remotely.
This command also allows to redefine which button controls which relay for the double switch (not supported for QBKG25LM).

Topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/system/set` should be used to modify operation mode.

**NOTE:** For QBKG25LM instead of `system` use `left`, `center` or `right` and leave out the `button` property in the payload.

Payload:
```js
{
  "operation_mode": {
    "button": "single"|"left"|"right", // Always use single for a single switch
    "state": "VALUE"
  }
}
```

Values                | Description
----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
`control_relay`       | Button directly controls relay (for single switch and QBKG25LM)
`control_left_relay`  | Button directly controls left relay (for double switch, not supported for QBKG25LM)
`control_right_relay` | Button directly controls right relay (for double switch, not supported for QBKG25LM)
`decoupled`           | Button doesn't control any relay

`zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/system/get` to read current mode.

Payload:
```js
{
  "operation_mode": {
    "button": "single"|"left"|"right" // Always use single for a single switch
  }
}
```

Response will be sent to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME`, example: `{"operation_mode_right":"control_right_relay"}`


### Pairing
Press and hold the button on the device for +- 10 seconds
(until the blue light starts blinking and stops blinking), release and wait.



## Exposes

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

### Power (numeric)
Instantaneous measured power.
Value can be found in the published state on the `power` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"power": ""}`.
It's not possible to write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `W`.

### Energy (numeric)
Sum of consumed energy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `energy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `kWh`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Measured electrical potential value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `V`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `single`, `release`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
