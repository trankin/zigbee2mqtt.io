## Notes

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../information/configuration.md)*

* `temperature_precision`: Controls the precision of `temperature` values,
e.g. `0`, `1` or `2`; default `2`.
To control the precision based on the temperature value set it to e.g. `{30: 0, 10: 1}`,
when temperature >= 30 precision will be 0, when temperature >= 10 precision will be 1. Precision will take into affect with next report of device.
* `temperature_calibration`: Allows to manually calibrate temperature values,
e.g. `1` would add 1 degree to the temperature reported by the device; default `0`. Calibration will take into affect with next report of device.


### (Dis)arming
To (dis)arm the keypad send to `zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set` payload:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
    "mode": "arm_all_zones" // Mode "arm_all_zones" or "disarm"
    }
}
```

### (Dis)arming from the keypad
When an attempt for (dis)arm is done on the keypad, Zigbee2MQTT will publish the following payload to topic `zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME`:

```js
{
    "action": "arm_all_zones", // OR "disarm" when being disarmed
    "action_code": "123", // The code being entered
    "action_zone": 0, // The zone being (dis)armed (always 0)
    "action_transaction": 99 // The transaction number
}
```

In case you want to confirm this action (e.g. `action_code` value is OK), respond to it by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/[DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME/set` payload:

```js
{
    "arm_mode": {
    "transaction": 99, // Transaction number (take this value from the (dis)arm attempt property `action_transaction`)
    "mode": "arm_all_zones" // Mode "arm_all_zones", "disarm" or "exit_delay" (take this value from the (dis)arm attempt property `action`)
    }
}
```



## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Voltage (numeric)
Voltage of the battery in millivolts.
Value can be found in the published state on the `voltage` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `mV`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Tamper (binary)
Indicates whether the device is tampered.
Value can be found in the published state on the `tamper` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` tamper is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Contact (binary)
Indicates if the contact is closed (= true) or open (= false).
Value can be found in the published state on the `contact` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `false` contact is ON, if `true` OFF.

### Action_code (numeric)
Value can be found in the published state on the `action_code` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Action_zone (text)
Value can be found in the published state on the `action_zone` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `°C`.

### Action (enum)
Triggered action (e.g. a button click).
Value can be found in the published state on the `action` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `disarm`, `arm_day_zones`, `identify`, `arm_night_zones`, `arm_all_zones`, `exit_delay`, `emergency`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.

## Manual Home Assistant configuration
Although Home Assistant integration through [MQTT discovery](../integration/home_assistant) is preferred,
manual integration is possible with the following configuration:
