## Notes


### Pairing
If pairing failed, try the followings:
- PMake sure door are in open state

If value equals `true` master_pin_mode is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Rfid_enable (binary)
Allow RFID to unlock.
Value can be found in the published state on the `rfid_enable` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"rfid_enable": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"rfid_enable": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `true` rfid_enable is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Lock_mode (enum)
