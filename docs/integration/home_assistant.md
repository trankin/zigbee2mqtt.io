# Home Assistant

*NOTE 1: This file has been generated, do not edit this file manually!*

*NOTE 2: If you are using the [Zigbee2MQTT Hass.io add-on](https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt)
use their documentation*


## MQTT discovery
**NOTE:** Groups are not auto-discovered, see configuration below.

The easiest way to integrate Zigbee2MQTT with Home Assistant is by
using [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).
This allows Zigbee2MQTT to automatically add devices to Home Assistant.

To achieve the best possible integration (including MQTT discovery):
- In your **Zigbee2MQTT** `configuration.yaml` set `homeassistant: true`
- In your **Home Assistant** `configuration.yaml`:

{% raw %}
```yaml
mqtt:
  discovery: true
  broker: [YOUR MQTT BROKER]  # Remove if you want to use builtin-in MQTT broker
  # birth_message and will_message is not required anymore for Home Assistant 0.113 >=
  birth_message:
    topic: 'homeassistant/status'
    payload: 'online'
  will_message:
    topic: 'homeassistant/status'
    payload: 'offline'
```
{% endraw %}

Zigbee2MQTT is expecting Home Assistant to send it's birth/will
messages to `homeassistant/status`. If you are using a Home Assistant version newer than 0.113,
this is configured by default. If you are using an older version, be sure to add this to your `configuration.yaml`
if you want Zigbee2MQTT to resend the cached values when Home Assistant restarts

## Home Assistant device registry
When using Home Assistant MQTT discovery, Zigbee2MQTT integrates
with the [Home Assistant device registry](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/device_registry_index.html).
This allows you to change the Home Assistant `device_id` and `friendly_name` from the web interface
without having to restart Home Assistant. It also makes it possible to show which entities belong to which device.

![Device registry](../images/home_assistant_device_registry.png)

## Customizing discovery
The device specifc configuration allows you to modify the discovery payload. Here you can also prevent a device from being discovered. See [Device specific configuration](../information/configuration.md) for the available options.

## I'm confused about the different device IDs, names and friendly names
- Home Assistant `device_id`: determined on first discovery of the device, can only be changed
via the Home Assistant web interface afterwards. Used to control/read the state from the device (e.g. in automations)
- Zigbee2MQTT `friendly_name`: used to change the MQTT topic where the device listens and publishes to.
- Home Assistant `name`: name shown in the Home Assistant UI (unless overridden
via a `friendly_name` in `customize.yaml`). If not changed via the Home Assistant web interface,
it is equal to the Zigbee2MQTT `friendly_name`. Is updated if the Zigbee2MQTT `friendly_name` changes
(requires restart of Home Assistant)
- Home Assistant `friendly_name` (`customize.yaml`): overrides the name in the Home Assistant web interface.

## Responding to button clicks
To respond to button clicks (e.g. WXKG01LM) you can use one of the following three Home Assistant configurations.

### Via MQTT device trigger (recommended)
[MQTT device trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_trigger.mqtt/) is the recommended way to respond to button clicks.
Note that it atleast requires Home Assistant 0.106.0.

The MQTT device triggers are discovered by Zigbee2MQTT once the event is triggered on the device once.

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button click
    trigger:
    - device_id: ad44cabee4c646f493814306aa6446e1
      discovery_id: 0x000b57fffecb472d action_arrow_left_click
      domain: mqtt
      platform: device
      subtype: arrow_left_click
      type: action
    action:
      entity_id: light.my_bulb_light
      service: light.toggle
```
{% endraw %}

If you only plan to use this and want to disable the *Via Home Assistant entity* integration below, set `homeassistant_legacy_triggers: false` (see [Configuration](../information/configuration.md) for more info).

### Via Home Assistant entity

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button click
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.my_switch_click
      to: 'single'
    action:
      entity_id: light.my_bulb_light
      service: light.toggle
```
{% endraw %}

### Via MQTT
As an alternative to the above way of integrating, you can also listen to MQTT topics.

{% raw %}
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button clicks
    trigger:
      platform: mqtt
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME'
    condition:
      condition: template
      value_template: '{{ "single" == trigger.payload_json.click }}'
    action:
      entity_id: light.bedroom
      service: light.toggle
```
{% endraw %}

## Groups
Groups are not auto-discovered.
With the configuration below, grouped devices in Zigbee2MQTT will be exposed as a single device in Home Assistant.
The following example will show you how to add a group of lights to Home Assistant.
It has to be added to the Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`.

{% raw %}

```
light:
  - platform: mqtt
    schema: json
    name: MY_GROUP_NAME
    command_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/[GROUP_FRIENDLY_NAME]/set"
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/[GROUP_FRIENDLY_NAME]"

    // Modify according to features supported by all devices in group
    color_temp: true
    brightness: true
    rgb: true
```

{% endraw %}

## Exposing switch as a light
If your device is currently discovered as a switch and you want to discover it as a light, the following config in the Zigbee2MQTT `configuration.yaml` can be used:

```yaml
devices:
  "0x12345678":
    friendly_name: my_switch
    homeassistant:
      switch:
        type: light
        object_id: light
      light:
        name: my_switch
      # OR if your devices has multiple endpoints (e.g. left/right)
      switch_left:
        type: light
        object_id: light_left
      switch_right:
        type: light
        object_id: light_right
```
If you are also using device specific overrides, make sure that they are configured under the new device type rather than the original device type.

## Controlling Zigbee2MQTT via Home Assistant
The following Home Assistant configuration allows you to control Zigbee2MQTT from Home Assistant.

You can add it to the appropriate section of your `configuration.yaml`, or you can add it as a [Home Assistant Package](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) by adding the following to `zigbee2mqtt.yaml` in your packages folder.

{% raw %}
```yaml
